# Prototype-LotR-GPS
## A Lord of the Rings themed walking app.

#### This mobile application will compare the ground covered in your daily travels with the journey of Frodo and the One Ring as described in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Users will be able to view a map of Middle Earth and two distance tracking progress bars. The first progress bar represents the users distance to the next major story milestone, while the second progress bar represents the distance travelled compared to the whole journey.

#### Once this prototype has been developed and tested the application functionality will be transfered to an external Xamarin project featuring a master-detail format with a flyout menu for cleaner and more intuitive UI.

Features:
- `Middle Earth Map`
- `Milestone Distance Progress Bar`
- `Full Journey Distance Progress Bar`
- `Start & Stop Tracking Buttons`
- `Reset Journey Button`
- `GPS Accuracy Options Slider`
- `Background GPS Enable/Disable Toggle`
  - `Background GPS Frequency Slider`
